Dot Product Usage:
There are two usages for dot product. The first example is by pressing the space bar. You can tell if you are behind the ghost in the shower or not.
The second example is if you're too far in front of the ghosts (except for the one in the kitchen), the ghosts will look at you until they lose line of sight.
The code for the first example can be found in PlayerMovement, and the second example can be found in Observer. 

Linear Interpolation:
There are two lights (one located at the bottom of the map, and another located near the last ghost) that move back and forth using linear interpolation. 
This code can be found in Light_Lerp

Particle Effect:
A particle effect is added to each of the ghosts, where they send off small balls of light as they move.
